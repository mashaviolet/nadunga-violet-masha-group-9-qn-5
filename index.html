        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <p>Masha’s journey began in her grandmother’s kitchen, where she learned the basics of baking from scratch. Growing up, Masha always believed in the beauty of homemade food—the warmth it brings to a family, the memories tied to a favorite recipe, and the comfort in each bite. After years of refining her craft, studying culinary arts, and traveling to learn unique baking techniques from around the world, Masha opened her bakery with one simple goal: to share the joy of homemade, artisan baked goods with her community.</p>
